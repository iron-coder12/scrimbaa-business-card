# scrimbaa-business-card
A scrimbaa react solo project where we had to make a static page using React. 
If you have any suggestions and improvements then please create an issue.
P.S. I am stil learning react
Basically This is what we needed to make:

And this is my attempt:
<br>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/968508474038317107/1050117736656797696/image.png" />

To run this:
<br>
git clone this repository

###Then Run:
```
npm i
```
This will install all the packages

###Then Run:
```
npm run dev
```

This should get the app up and running!
